            <p>Welcome to Austral Aurora Advisors, a unique project in Chile dedicated to offering specialized consultancy in risk management associated with space weather. We provide continuous space weather monitoring services focused on the protection of satellites, solar activity, and geomagnetic activity. Our approach is directed toward large companies or institutions, especially those managing their own satellites or substations, helping them make informed decisions about the new challenges posed by space weather, particularly damages associated with geomagnetic induced currents (GICs) during geomagnetic storms and substorms related to solar activity. 
              
              <br>
                        
              From Chile, Austral Aurora Advisors aims to be a regional leader, supporting key sectors such as energy, mining, air transport, telecommunications, satellite operators, and other industries sensitive to the effects of space weather. Through expert analysis and a personalized approach, we help our clients make informed decisions and strengthen their operations' resilience against the risks associated with these natural phenomena.

              <br>
              Monitoring is conducted through specialized analysis of solar observations using satellite stations, as well as ground-based magnetic field observations. This analysis is carried out by experts with more than 12 years of experience in the field.
